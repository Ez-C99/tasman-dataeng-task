# Dev Log

A diary of the design and development of my solution

## 2025-08-18 - [TBD]

### Actions

- [TBD]

### Notes

- Had to work quite a bit later than 5pm usual to fix some bugs but nothing a little nap to re-energise can't fix.

---

## 2025-08-17 - Completed the technical desdign doc

### Actions

- Completed the technical design doc and initial data analysis (mostly).
- Designed the first iteration of the schema, based on the analysis.
- Mostly completed stack design choice and justifications,
- Got a good way into implementation architecture, design and planning

### Notes

- It was another slightly disjointed working session since it was my mum's birthday now so I couldn't do anything in the morning and had to travel back to my flat in the evening. I progressed well in whatever time I had available though.

## 2025-08-16 - Finished requirements gathering and started design doc

### Actions

- Finished gathering requirements from the brief and put together high level solution overview diagram at the bottom.
- Started the [Technical Design & Planning]() doc.
- Progressed to the initial data pull and analysis from the API with Postman in the early hours of the next day.

### Notes

- I could only really work on the design and planning doc for a couple hours, from the late morning to early afternoon, since it was my aunt's birthday and she was visiting from Ghana. I had to travel from my flat to my family home but I liked the way the solution was coming together.
- Managed to work on it more in the very late night.

## 2025-08-15 - Brief insights and requirements gathering

### Actions

- Started the initial insights and requirements gathering from the brief by annotating and notetaking over the task brief with my iPad.
- The doc is linked here: [Brief Insights and Requirements](docs/Brief_Insights_and_Requirements.pdf).

### Notes

- Tired from work and the week but I finally had the time and energy to properly start the task, after some post-work rest.

## 2025-08-14 - Fundamentals and theory recap

### Actions

- Recapped the O'Reilly Fundamentals of Data Engineering book to revise the concepts I want to present in my solution.

### Notes

- As I explained to Aileen Tolentino in email the busy week wouldn't allow me to truly get onto the task until later but I had to do whatever I could to prepare.
- Just like in basketball (and basketball imitates life), fundamentals are key.
